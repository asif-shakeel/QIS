Quantum computers have become accessible to the public. In the current era of Noisy-Intermediate-Scale-Quantum devices, an algorithm run on a quantum computer is impacted by the noise and decoherence of the device. In desigining an algorithm meant for a quantum computer, reducing the size and depth of a quantum circuit becomes a serious consideration as a result. This repository contains contributions to the research and development of ideas and algorithms that address problems of interest from the author's point of view. These include quantum simulation, quantum algorithms, and code for the quantum computers.
